2004-02-09  Daniel Larsson  <daniel.larsson@servicefactory.se>

	* sqlquery.py: Added 'literal', to convert literal values to valid
	  SQL literals.
	  (Table.reachable): Calculate if a table is reachable from this
	  table, directly or recursively.
	  (QueryBinaryOp.__init__): Allow multiple operands, not only two.
	  (QueryBinaryOp.__str__): Renamed from 'expr'. Literals are now
	  inserted into the calculated expression rather than returned
	  separately, forcing the user to handle them explicitly.
	  (Select.__where): Try include more tables if not all tables in
	  the query are connected.  If a table is found which connects the
	  tables, it is included in the query, and relational constraint
	  expressions are added to avoid the cartesian product which would
	  otherwise result.

	* makedoc.xsl: Removed copy&paste code which wasn't used.

	* sqlquery.py (__all__): Added GREATER_* and LESS_* as exported
	symbols. Those are functions for creating queries.

2004-01-28  Daniel Larsson  <daniel.larsson@servicefactory.se>

	* makesql.xsl: Ignore all <doc:...> tags in output.

	* makedoc.xsl: New file, convert an sqlml file into a DocBook
	fragment.

	* example/Makefile (doc): Added rule to build a DocBook fragment
	from the SQL description file.

	* example/orderdb.xml: Added some documentation tags.

	* sqlquery.py (Select.select): 'group_by' can be a single field,
	and not only a sequence.
