* Managing the audiostore
  
** Web interface to add and remove songs

   Adding songs, at least in bulk, is cumbersome to do through a web
   interface, but removing songs works well.  Should have various
   tools available, such as finding duplicates.
  
** Create and edit playlists through web

   Virtually no support for playlists exists right now, other than the
   tables in the database.
  
** Editing song information

   The python classes support very powerful editing capabilities on
   sets of songs.  A nice web interface to expose these capabilities
   would be really nice.  Not quite sure how that would look yet, but
   it should be possible to do things like "set artist of all songs
   where artist matches '*beatles*' to "The Beatles", and set the
   sortname to 'Beatles, The'".

* Appearance

** Fix some default icons for the menues

   Too bad I suck at doing graphics...

** "Splash" graphics on the front page

   See previous item...

** Improved menues

   Find a good javascript/DHTML menu package, and use this instead of
   my halfhearted, no-good menu.  In particular, things like selecting
   language should preferably be a popup menu, not separate entries on
   the menu bar.

** Complete i18n-ize remus

   The ground work is mostly done, and most of the translations for
   the currently available pages are done, in fact.

** Link back to top page from music pages

   Currently there is no link back to the top page from the music
   pages.  This should obviously be fixed.  The pages generated from
   index.html.xsl, and the more static pages of remus are
   fundamentally different, from a generation standpoint. The former
   are generated solely from XSLT, the latter using the
   twisted.web.woven framework.  Perhaps the XSLT generated pages
   should be part of a twisted.web.woven page?  Would help make pages
   uniform at least.  If so, this particular item becomes moot, as the
   music pages would inherit the global menu (which has a 'Home'
   link).

* Sound formats

** Finally add support for OGG and other formats

   Ogg has a tag mechanism similar to ID3 for MP3. SID songs have some
   form of tags too.  I know too little about the other formats yet
   (ac3, flac, etc), but the blurb in /usr/ports/audio/flac says
   "FLAC has an extendable metadata system".

* Architectural problems

** Support albums with multiple artists

   Right now, an album refers to a single artist.  To support multiple
   artists per album, I will need to separate out the album/artist
   relation into a separate table, containing artist/album pairs.
   (Songs should refer to entries in this table rather than album and
   artist separately).
