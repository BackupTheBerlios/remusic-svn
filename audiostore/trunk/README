* Prerequisites:

  These are the various software packages used by audiostore.  Other
  versions of these packages may work, but these are the versions
  I am using at the moment:

  * Python 2.3
  * MySQL 3.23.57
  * twisted 1.1.0
  * id3lib-3.8.3
  * mpg123-0.59r_9
  * vorbis-tools-1.0
  * cadaver-0.22.0 (*)

  These are the packages audiostore uses directly.  Most of the above
  packages in turn depend on other packages, which aren't included
  here.  Refer to respective package's installation instructions.

  (*) cadaver isn't used, but it's a nice command line webdav client,
  quite handy for browsing the audiostore.

* Installation

  When the above packages are installed, run (as root):

  # python setup.py install

  Edit /usr/local/etc/audiostore.conf if you want to make any local
  adjustments.

  Eventually this will be configurable from the above file, but right
  now, to change which CSS file is used to display the HTML pages from
  the audiostore server is hardcoded into the XSLT stylesheet which is
  used to generate the HTML pages.  To change the look of these, fiddle
  with the following files directly:

  /usr/local/libdata/remus/styles/index.html.xsl
  /usr/local/libdata/remus/styles/audiostore.css

  The format of the XML file which is processed by the above XSLT code
  isn't specified anywhere as of yet.  I'll write up a DTD or a schema
  one day (it's extremely simple though, and should be obvious from
  reading the XSL file, if you know a bit about XSL.  Not everything
  from the database is currently exposed in the XML, most noticably
  genres, but also audio format is missing, and more.  This will
  likely change in the not too distant future.


* Running the server

  Due to some limitations in python's distutils, the daemon program is
  located in /usr/local/bin (and not in /usr/local/libexec which I
  would have preferred).  I'll fix this at some point.  Anyhow, to
  start the server, run '/usr/local/bin/remus_server'. Unless you
  change the port number from the default 80, you need to run this as
  root (change this in /usr/local/etc/audiostore.conf).
