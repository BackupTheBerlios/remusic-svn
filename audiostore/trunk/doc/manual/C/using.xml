    <title>Using the audiostore</title>

    <para> Before you can start using the audiostore, the audiostore
    server must be running.  [ Installation should be covered
    somewhere.  Still undefined how the server integrates the
    audiostore with other parts of Remus.  Likely, starting the server
    is the same regardless what components are installed. ]
    </para>
    
    <para> Assuming the audiostore has been populated with some audio
    files, here's what it could look like using Nautilus:

	  <imagedata format="PNG" fileref="figures/Screenshot-Nautilus.png" />
	</imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    As you can see, the top of the audiostore tree contains
    <emphasis>genre</emphasis> directories.  Under each genre, you'll
    find artist directories, which contain album directories.
    </para>

    <para>What differs the audiostore from a conventional file system,
    is it has alternative directory roots.  One example is typing in
    <filename>http://<replaceable>url-base</replaceable>/music/artist</filename>
    which will list all artists regardless of genre.

	  <imagedata format="PNG" fileref="figures/Screenshot-Nautilus-artists.png" />
	</imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    </para>

    <para>Similarily it is possible to list all albums in the
    audiostore through the URL
    <filename>http://<replaceable>url-base</replaceable>/music/album</filename>:

    <figure>
      <title>Browsing the audiostore albums</title>
      <mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
	  <imagedata format="PNG" fileref="figures/Screenshot-Nautilus-albums.png" />
	</imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    </para>
