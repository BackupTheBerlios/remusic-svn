The audiostore provides a generic mechanism to deliver song
information in custom formats, based on XSLT.  These stylesheets are
invoked for URLs ending in "/list/<type>",
e.g. "http://remusserver/music/artist/The%20Hives/list/list.m3u".

Adding a new format is a matter of writing an XSLT stylesheet, and
placing it in /usr/local/libdata/remus/styles.  The source XML format
isn't yet formalized in a DTD/Schema/RelaxNG model, but looking at
these existing stylesheets should give you enough details.  Look in
remus/audiostore/as_collection.py (IndexXML.create_file) for the exact
structure for now.

This directory contains 3 different XSLT stylesheets:

- index.html.xsl, which generates an HTML page listing information
  about songs. param.xsl contains parameters to this stylesheet, some
  of which are adjustable by the user. audiostore.css defines the
  visual appearance of the elements produced by index.html.xsl

- list.m3u.xsl, which generates an extended M3U playlist. The
  accompanying file m3u.mime defines the mime type of the result of
  the transformation (audio/x-mpegurl).  In general, <type>.mime
  contains the mime type of the results from applying stylesheet
  <type>.xsl. If no <type>.mime file is found, the mime type is set to
  text/xml.

- remus.xsl, which is an XML based playlist, used by the remus audio
  player.
