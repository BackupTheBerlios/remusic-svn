* Release 0.4.2

  2004-02-13

** Bugfixes

*** Localization

    Localization was rather braindead in previous versions, since the
    "current language" information was server wide, thus all clients
    were affected by language switches (duh...).  Now this information
    is kept in the session object, which is unique per browser session.

*** Appropriate audio file extensions

    Audio file URLs now have an appropriate "file" extension based on
    its content type, instead of no extension at all. 


* Release 0.4.1

  2004-02-11

** Changes

   Database change, reinserting the songs needed.

   Common menu on all pages.

   Validation links on all pages.
   

** Bugfixes

*** Improved browser support

    IE6 is a bit more picky about XHTML files, doesn't support XML
    header, etc.

*** Character encoding problems

    Fixed various character encoding problems, think I'm beginning to
    understand this i18n mess.
    

* Release 0.4.0 - Localization

  2004-02-03

** Changes

  Added localization support, for twisted based pages using gettext,
  and for XSLT generated pages, using Norman Walsh's l10n package,
  part of the docbook-xsl package.
