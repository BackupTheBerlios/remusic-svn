	* Added custom distutil command, so I can create the SQL tables on
	installation. distutils is a fairly complex system, I noticed...

	* Added generation of HTML pages when "directory" nodes are
	accessed with a GET request (what browsers typically do).  WebDAV
	clients find out about directories and their contents differently,
	so they aren't affected by this (other than if you try to 'cat' a
	directory, or similar).

	When generating HTML pages, first an XML file is generated from
	the database, which is fed through xsltproc with an XSLT style
	sheet, and the resulting HTML page is sent back.

	* Added setup.py for installation / distribution building.

	* Added audiostore_resync tool which regenerates the SQL
	information from the audio files. Mostly useful when changing the
	database structure, or fixing tag parsing.
