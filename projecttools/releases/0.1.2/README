* Remus projecttools

  This module contains common files for the various subparts of
  remus. At the moment, this is limited to files for document
  generation, most notably makefiles for producing HTML and PDF
  documentation, common XML entity files, and customizations of Norman
  Walsh's DocBook XSL stylesheets. The customizations are based on the
  Gnome Project's customization, but slightly simplified those, and
  adapted to a newer version of the XSL stylesheets.
