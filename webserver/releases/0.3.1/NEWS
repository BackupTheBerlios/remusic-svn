* Release 0.3.1

  2004-02-13

** Bugfixes

*** Localization

    Localization was rather braindead in previous versions, since the
    "current language" information was server wide, thus all clients
    were affected by language switches (duh...).  Now this information
    is kept in the session object, which is unique per browser session.


* Release 0.3.0

** Changes

   New menu widget and model, with associated DHTML menu implemented
   in javascript.

** Bugfixes

   XML header in XHTML pages aren't liked by IE6, so I've removed
   those.
