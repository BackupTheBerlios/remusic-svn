* Introduction

  This is the basic webserver framework used in remus. It is based on
  the twisted framework (http://twistedmatrix.com) and most notably
  contains a WebDAV resource, adapted from Christian Scholz davserver
  package, a WebDAV implementation for the webserver part of the
  standard python distribution (BasicHTTPServer).

  At the moment, this package is aware of, and is using
  remus.audiostore, thus violating the layered design. This is
  basically a deployment issue (the audiostore needs to know the local
  filesystem root), and I'll make this information obtainable for
  submodules later.
