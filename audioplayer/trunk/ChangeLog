	* remus/player/pluginmp3.py (mpg123_plugin.fast_forward)
	(mpg123_plugin.fast_backward): New methods implementing fast
	forward and fast backward play.  Fast backward has limited use,
	since we're normally not playing from a file, and buffers are
	likely not big enough to back up very long.

	* curses_player (keyboard_handler.handle_read): Added fast forward
	and fast backward. The latter doesn't work very well with Remus
	though, since it isn't playing from files directly.

	* Started implementing the framework.
