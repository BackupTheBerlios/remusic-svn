	* remus/player/song.py: Playlist independent song information
	class.

	* remus/player/m3u_playlist.py: Renamed from
	playlist.py. Implements parsing of m3u playlists. Modified for the
	new song.py module.

	* remus/player/remus_playlist.py: Parse remus playlists (XML
	format).

	* remus/player/player.py: Audio player framework built around the
	gstreamer multimedia framework.

	* curses_player.in: Rewritten to use remus.player.player, the
	gstreamer based player framework.

	* remus/player/pluginmp3.py (mpg123_plugin.fast_forward)
	(mpg123_plugin.fast_backward): New methods implementing fast
	forward and fast backward play.  Fast backward has limited use,
	since we're normally not playing from a file, and buffers are
	likely not big enough to back up very long.

	* curses_player (keyboard_handler.handle_read): Added fast forward
	and fast backward. The latter doesn't work very well with Remus
	though, since it isn't playing from files directly.

	* Started implementing the framework.
